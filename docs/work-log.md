# Implementation work log

Progress against `docs/phased-plan.markdown`, and the items an agent cannot
complete on its own. Anything under "Handed back" needs a human with account
access, a vendor relationship, or a physical device, and is blocking the issue
it sits under until someone does it.

## Completed

### Issue 1: repository skeleton and toolchain

pnpm workspace over `server`, `infra`, and `packages/contract`, with TypeScript
5.9 in `strict` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, Biome for lint and format, and
Vitest projects. `pnpm run check` runs lint, typecheck, and tests from the
repository root in one command, which is the issue's acceptance boundary.

`app/` holds a README rather than a package. The Expo project is issue 27, and
scaffolding it early would put an unused jest-expo toolchain in the repository
for the whole of phases 1 through 4.

## Handed back

Nothing yet.
